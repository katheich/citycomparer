# Project #2: Metropolists

## Overview

This is my second project of the software engineering immersive course at GA London. The assignment was a mini hackathon to **build a React application** that consumes a **public API**. The project was to be completed **in teams of 2** within **48 hours**.



You can launch the game on GitHub pages [here](https://katheich.github.io/metropolists/), or find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/katheich/metropolists).

## Brief
- **Consume a public API** â€“ this could be anything but it must make sense for your project.
- **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.
- **The app should include a router** - with several "pages".
- **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public.

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)
- React.js
- Teleport API
- Git and GitHub
- Bulma
- Google Fonts
